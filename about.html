        <h2>The Two Most Famous Ransomware attacks!</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="colone ">
        <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts your files and demands a ransom to decrypt them. It is a very common type of malware, and it is very dangerous. It is also very profitable for the attackers. It is a very serious threat to your data, and you should be very careful about it.</p>

          <h4>WannaCry</h4>

          <div class="talkonetext">
              <p>The wannacry ransomware attack is one of the worst ones in United States and world history. It quickly gained mass reputation for quickly gaining on to a host computer and infecting it with its software and taking it over.  It was able to do this through a bug in the system known as the Eternal blue error. This allowed them to remotely add the ransomware software onto the computer, then encrypting all of the valuable files onto it, and essentially locking the target out of their own computer. The wannacry virus essentially encrypted the user's files and made them pay a ransom payment, in the form of Bitcoin in order to eventually decrypt them. However most if not all of the time even if the ransom was paid. The encrypted files would not always be decrypted and would eventually be completely gone after the week-long troubles with the computer.  as this had happened back in 2017, the wannacry ransomware virus why would be relatively new most people were able to combat it as similar things have happened like this in the past.</p>
          <p>Here is a screenshot of the ransomware in action:</p>

      <div class="talktwo">
        <h4>NotPetya</h4>
        <div class="coltwo">
            </div>
        <div class="talktwotext">
            <p>The NotPetya Ransomware attack is also another one of the biggest right underneath the wannacry ransomware attack. It almost hit the same as the wannacry, except it infected more work station machines and it was able to bring down an entire country to have an almost no internet. This main attack was brought on in 2 the Ukraine and essentially brought down the entire Ukrainian government and their internal internet networks. Amazing lead this attack was actually brought on by the United Amazingly this attack was actually brought on by the United States NSA branch.  and it was required to be private code. However it was able to get leet in 2017 and it eventually spread to countries, where it mainly affected Ukraine using a trojan horse showing out where and eventually shut down most of the internet there. So how was it able to work? It was able to work using the MBR,  which stands for the master boot record, which means it over rights the Windows boot loader and every time it restarts the payload and criples the system which allows it to no longer boot into windows. This attack was able to compromise over four hundred million dollars worth of computers and ransomware money. This ransomware attack is able to be kind of beating but not fully the in and kind of put off. It is able to do that by creating a file that is only allowed to be read only by the computer and other operating system software in a specific file system inside the Windows system.            </p>
